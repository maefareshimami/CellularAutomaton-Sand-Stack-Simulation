# Cellular Automaton - Sand Stack Simulation
> If you use my code or a part of it for your projects, thank you for quoting me!

I represent a half-sand stack in 2D.
You can choose a the number of elementary columns, or stacks, to form a huge stack.
The grains fall randomly in the simulation. It represents, for instance, wind on the sand.

## Protocol
Put all files in a same folder and write `python main.py` in your terminal.
Write the number of stacks you want in the terminal (100 for example).

Next step is to modeling a 3D sand stack...
